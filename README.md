# 💷 LedgerFlow: Intelligent Command-Line Expense Management System

<p align="center">
  <b>A structured, CSV-backed command-line finance tracker engineered for rapid expense logging, filtering, and lifecycle management.</b><br>
  Designed for local-first financial telemetry, persistent storage handling, and extensible multi-parameter query architecture.
</p>

---

<h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>

<p>
<b>LedgerFlow</b> is a fully interactive command-line expense tracking system developed as a native Python solution for the <b><a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker" target="_blank">Expense Tracker</a></b> project challenge on <b>roadmap.sh</b>.
</p>

<p>
The application was engineered to simulate a lightweight personal finance management environment directly inside the terminal. Rather than relying on databases or third-party financial frameworks, LedgerFlow intentionally utilises structured CSV persistence to reinforce practical understanding of local file operations, record management, and transactional state handling.
</p>

<p>
Built with an extensible architecture and powered by Python's <code>argparse</code> module, the system supports dynamic expense creation, targeted querying, expense mutation, deletion workflows, CSV exporting, and temporal filtering by day, month, year, or exact date values.
</p>

---

<h2>🧠 Architectural Philosophy & Design Intent</h2>

<p>
LedgerFlow was intentionally designed around a <b>local-first persistence model</b>, meaning every financial transaction is stored directly inside a human-readable CSV datastore rather than abstracted behind external database engines.
</p>

<p>
This design philosophy was implemented for several deliberate technical and educational reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Practical Reinforcement of File Handling:</b>  
    The project was engineered to provide repeated, hands-on exposure to Python file I/O operations, structured CSV manipulation, data serialisation, and runtime persistence management. Every expense insertion, modification, deletion, or export operation directly interacts with the filesystem.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Transparent Data Structures:</b>  
    Unlike hidden database layers, the application's storage system remains fully inspectable. Users can open <code>expenses.csv</code> directly and observe precisely how structured financial records are represented and manipulated programmatically.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>CLI-Centric Workflow Optimisation:</b>  
    The application avoids graphical overhead entirely in favour of highly deterministic command execution. This creates an efficient workflow for users comfortable operating inside shell environments and allows for rapid data management through positional arguments and flags.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Scalable Query Foundations:</b>  
    While the current implementation processes one filtering parameter at a time during view operations, the internal architecture already introduces transitional list-based result handling designed to support future multi-filter querying systems.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>🖥️ Detailed Usage & Command Manual</h2>

<p>
LedgerFlow operates through a modular subcommand architecture powered by <code>argparse</code>.
</p>

---

<h3>1. Adding New Expenses</h3>

<p>
Create a brand-new financial transaction entry:
</p>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py add --description "Coffee" --amount 4.50 --category "Food" --date 23-05-2026
</pre>

---

<h3>2. Viewing All Expenses</h3>

<p>
Display every stored expense record:
</p>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view
</pre>

---

<h3>3. Filtering Expenses</h3>

<p>
Query expenses using targeted filtering parameters:
</p>

<h4>Filter By Category</h4>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view --category Food
</pre>

<h4>Filter By Date</h4>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view --date 23-05-2026
</pre>

<h4>Filter By Month</h4>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view --month May
</pre>

<h4>Filter By Year</h4>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view --year 2026
</pre>

<h4>Filter By Description</h4>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view --description Coffee
</pre>

---

<h3>4. Updating Existing Expenses</h3>

<p>
Modify existing expense records using either an ID or description lookup:
</p>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py update --id 3 --amount 12.99
</pre>

<i>Example updating multiple fields simultaneously:</i>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py update --description Coffee --newdescription "Costa Coffee" --amount 5.20 --category Drinks
</pre>

---

<h3>5. Deleting Expenses</h3>

<p>
Delete records by ID:
</p>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py delete --id 5
</pre>

<p>
Or by description:
</p>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py delete --description Coffee
</pre>

---

<h2>⚙️ Code Architecture & Function Breakdown</h2>

<p>
The application is separated into modular operational blocks responsible for command parsing, data persistence, record transformation, and user interaction workflows.
</p>

---

<h3>CLI Bootloader & Argument Engine</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>on_load()</code>:  
    Initialises the command-line interface, configures all argparse subcommands, builds validation rules, and dynamically parses runtime user arguments.
  </li>
</ul>

---

<h3>Persistence & File Management</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>load_file()</code>:  
    Automatically creates the expense datastore if missing, loads structured CSV rows into memory, and returns a manipulatable list structure.
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>save_data(DATA)</code>:  
    Serialises active runtime expense records directly back into the CSV datastore while preserving field consistency.
  </li>
</ul>

---

<h3>Expense Lifecycle Controllers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>add_expense()</code>:  
    Generates unique IDs, validates date structures, normalises category formatting, and appends new expenses into persistent storage.
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>update_expense()</code>:  
    Handles selective record mutation using either unique IDs or description references while preserving untouched fields.
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>delete_expense()</code>:  
    Removes expense records safely while handling duplicate description conflicts through guided user feedback.
  </li>
</ul>

---

<h3>Query & Filtering System</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>view_all()</code>:  
    Renders the complete expense ledger to the terminal.
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>view_by()</code>:  
    Processes dynamic expense filtering across multiple financial dimensions including temporal queries, categories, IDs, and textual descriptions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>export_to_csv()</code>:  
    Exports filtered query results into a standalone CSV report for external analysis or archival storage.
  </li>
</ul>

---

<h3>System Utilities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>clear_screen()</code>:  
    Performs operating-system aware terminal clearing for cleaner UI presentation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <code>error_messages()</code>:  
    Displays staged runtime alerts with timed delays before safely terminating the application.
  </li>
</ul>

---

<h2>📂 Local Data Architecture</h2>

<p>
All financial records are stored inside <code>expenses.csv</code> using a structured column-based format:
</p>

<h3>Sample Datastore Layout</h3>

<pre>
ID,Date,Description,Amount,Category
1,2026-05-23,Coffee,4.50,FOOD
2,2026-05-24,Train Ticket,18.20,TRANSPORT
3,2026-05-25,Netflix,10.99,ENTERTAINMENT
</pre>

---

<h2>🧪 Current Limitations & Future Improvements</h2>

<p>
The current query engine processes one filter parameter at a time. A future architectural redesign is planned to support <b>multi-condition filtering</b>.
</p>

<p>
The intended future implementation involves generating a temporary in-memory results list containing all expense records before progressively eliminating entries that fail to match layered filter conditions.
</p>

<p>
This would allow advanced query combinations such as:
</p>

<pre>
python expense-tracker.py view --category Food --month May --year 2026
</pre>

<p>
Additional planned improvements include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-parameter query chaining</li>
  <li>Summary statistics and spending analytics</li>
  <li>Budget threshold monitoring</li>
  <li>Coloured terminal rendering</li>
  <li>SQLite backend migration</li>
  <li>Advanced report generation</li>
</ul>
