"""
This is the first version of the expense tracker that I am making for one of the projects on roadmap.sh. I would like to start using other file formats as I am familiar with using SQLite and JSON already.
I will upload both copies and link them here too and should be in my repo's.

The load function and the save data function was made with the help of AI and it wasn't all that difficult to make but with CSV's having so many options. I would say that I would want to learn all the funcitons inside this method before I would say I can code comfortably with this.

# Add an expense
# Delete an expense
# View all expenses
# Veiw expenses for a certain month
# Add expense categories and filter by categories for view
# Export a filter output as csv file
# Export expenses as csv output

## Create argparser for arguments that can be used and entered into the program. This helps with data and input validation the idea is to be able to parse arguments into temporary arg variables which can then be exported as a python variable to then be used for data santisation or validation and then input that in to the csv.
